            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Syntaxr's privacy policy for the mobile app "Cells" (hereby referred to as the "Application"). This document was created by Abdul Haseeb (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") to outline how user data is handled within this freemium service. This policy will be updated from time to time, and the most current version will be posted on this page.</p>
        </div>
        
<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our Application is designed with user privacy in mind, and as such, it does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, technical data, or sensitive details about the user or their device. The Application operates independently on your device, and all data related to the game remains local to your device at all times. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Application does not collect your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
        <li>The Application does not track or record any of the pages you visit within the Application, the time and date of those visits, or the duration spent on those pages.</li>
        <li>The Application does not access or collect any details about your mobile device's operating system or other technical specifications.</li>
        <li>No data is collected regarding the time spent using the Application or any user interactions within it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore, the Application does not collect or access any form of precise or approximate location data from your mobile device. There is no tracking of user behavior, and no analytics services are integrated into the Application that could gather or report user activity. In addition, the Application does not collect or share any data with third parties.</p>
    <p>All game-related data, such as progress, lives, scores, or other states, is stored solely on your device. This data is only used to maintain your in-game progress and is entirely isolated from any external servers or networks. Once the Application is uninstalled from your device, all stored data related to the game, including progress, lives, or other game states, will be permanently removed from the device, ensuring that no residual information remains.</p>
    <p>By using this Application, users can rest assured that their privacy is fully protected, and that no personal or technical data is being collected, transmitted, or stored beyond the scope of the game's operations on the local device. The privacy and integrity of your information are our utmost priority.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. User Data Storage and Local Data</h2>
            <p>All game-related data is stored locally on the user's device. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the Application is uninstalled, all progress and data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.</li>
                <li>We do not collect user account data, and players can start using the Application immediately without any sign-up or login requirements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

The Service Provider has already included a premium service that allows users to remove ads entirely.</p>
